Stuff I've developed, I've found useful or had a need for

xList
-----
This started as a need for a solution in a database where gender was hard coded in a few forms in a database as Male/Female and an organisation wanted a third gender, 'Child'. Then a fourth was added 'withheld'. Later another drop-down was needed for titles: Mr. Mrs. etc. that needed to be expandable. Rather than have lots of tiny database tables, I developed a method of storing multiple lists on a single table and having them available within code separately.

With lists such as these being held on a table they are then updatable by the database end user.
